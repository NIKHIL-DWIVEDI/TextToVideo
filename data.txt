On Sunday, a buddy of mine hosted a "Halloween party". So I considered playing the "Deadpool" role, which I thought would be entertaining. When i entered the "party" there were crazy things going on like "santa claus on bike" and then there was "spiderman sleeping" and in one corner "aquaman eating fish" which was ewww moment for me and last which shook me was "captain america in frock".
